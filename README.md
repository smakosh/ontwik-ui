# Ontwik-ui

A headless UI library and CLI theme generator

Powered by:

- üèé [Turborepo](https://turborepo.org) ‚Äî High-performance build system for Monorepos
- üöÄ [React](https://reactjs.org/) ‚Äî JavaScript library for user interfaces
- üõ† [Tsup](https://github.com/egoist/tsup) ‚Äî TypeScript bundler powered by esbuild
- üìñ [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) ‚Äî UI component environment powered by Vite

As well as a few others tools preconfigured:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for static type checking
- [Changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) for managing versioning and changelogs
- [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/changesets/action) for fully automated package publishing

## Getting Started

[Docs](https://ontwik-ui.smakosh.com/)

### Useful Commands

- `yarn dev` - Run all packages locally and preview with Storybook
- `yarn build` - Build all packages including the Storybook site
- `yarn lint` - Lint all packages
- `yarn changeset` - Generate a changeset
- `yarn clean` - Clean up all `node_modules` and `dist` folders (runs each package's clean script)

## Apps & Packages

This monorepo includes the following packages and applications:

- `apps/docs`: Component documentation site with Storybook
- `apps/public-docs`: Public Docs powered by [Nextra](https://nextra.vercel.app/)
- `packages/ontwik-ui`: Core React components

Each package and app is 90% [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). Yarn Workspaces enables us to "hoist" dependencies that are shared between packages to the root `package.json`. This means smaller `node_modules` folders and a better local dev experience. To install a dependency for the entire monorepo, use the `-W` workspaces flag with `yarn add`.

## Versioning & Publishing Packages

This repository uses [Changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) to manage versions, create changelogs, and publish to npm. It's preconfigured so you can start publishing packages immediatley.

### Generating the Changelog

To generate your changelog, run `yarn changeset` locally:

1. **Which packages would you like to include?** ‚Äì This shows which packages and changed and which have remained the same. By default, no packages are included. Press `space` to select the packages you want to include in the `changeset`.
1. **Which packages should have a major bump?** ‚Äì Press `space` to select the packages you want to bump versions for.
1. If doing the first major version, confirm you want to release.
1. Write a summary for the changes.
1. Confirm the changeset looks as expected.
1. A new Markdown file will be created in the `changeset` folder with the summary and a list of the packages included.

### Releasing

When you push your code to GitHub, the [GitHub Action](https://github.com/changesets/action) will run the `release` script defined in the root `package.json`:

```bash
turbo run build --filter=docs^... --filter=public-docs^... && changeset publish
```

Turborepo runs the `build` script for all publishable packages (excluding docs & public-docs) and publishes the packages to npm.
