### Fonts

I recommend that you use self-hosted fonts. You can customize the primary font in the theme typography object.

### Customize the font size, color, line height etc...

<Typography
  fontSize={24}
  lineHeight={22}
  fontWeight={400}
  letterSpacing={22}
  fontFamily="Roboto"
>
  Custom
</Typography>

```jsx
